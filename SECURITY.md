## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Codex Account Manager, please report it to our security team. 

**Email:** security@example.com (Replace with actual email or private reporting method)

### Process
1.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
2.  We will investigate the issue and confirm if it is a vulnerability.
3.  We will provide a patch/fix as soon as possible.
4.  We will credit you in the release notes (if you wish).

### Critical Areas
We significantly value reports on:
- Leakage of decrypted tokens.
- Privilege escalation (accessing others' vaults).
- Encryption weakness (AES key recovery).
