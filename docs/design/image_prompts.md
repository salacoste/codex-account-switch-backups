## 1. Hero Banner (The Secure Vault)
**Placement:** Top of README.
**Goal:** Convey "Military-grade security in a modern package".

**Prompt:**
> [Nanobanano Pro]
> **Subject:** A majestic, hyper-realistic 3D visualization of a digital vault floating in a dark, infinite data void. The vault is represented by a translucent, crystalline padlock glowing with an inner teal light, protected by rotating rings of golden and purple cryptographic code.
> **Details:** Surrounding the central lock are sleek, metallic data pipes connecting to "floating islands" representing different development environments (Cloud, Local, Staging), all securely tethered to the center.
> **Style & Atmosphere:** Cinematic 3D render (Octane Render style), depth of field focusing on the lock. The lighting should be dramatic, with a strong rim light highlighting the edges of the lock against the deep black background. No text.
> **Colors:** Dominant Deep Black, Accents of Cyan and Royal Purple.
> **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape)

## 2. Feature Visualization (Chaos vs Order)
**Placement:** Under "The Solution".
**Goal:** Visually demonstrate the pain of the "old way" vs the ease of the "new way".

**Prompt:**
> [Nanobanano Pro]
> **Subject:** A sleek, split-screen composition contrasting "The Problem" vs "The Solution".
> **Left Side (The Problem):** A desaturated, slightly gritty view of a developer's cluttered workspace. Screens are filled with chaotic green text, sticky notes with "API KEY??" stuck to the monitor, and a tangle of red cables symbolizing confusion and risk. Lighting is dim and warm/yellow.
> **Right Side (The Solution):** A pristine, high-tech interface in a clean, cool-toned environment. A holographic shield floats above a keyboard, radiating a calm teal light. Organized data streams flow smoothly into a central hub. The lighting is crisp, white, and blue, emphasizing clarity and speed.
> **Style:** High-end concept art, isometric perspective. The transition line between left and right should be a sharp, glowing diagonal cut.
> **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape)

## 3. The CLI Experience (Terminal UI Mockup)
**Placement:** Under "Features".
**Goal:** Showcase the tool's actual interface in a stylized, attractive way.

**Prompt:**
> [Nanobanano Pro]
> **Subject:** A photorealistic close-up of a high-resolution MacBook Pro screen displaying a beautiful, modern terminal window. The terminal (using a glassmorphism effect) is running `codex-account list`.
> **Screen Content:** Inside the terminal, distinct, colorful rows of text show account statuses: "✅ Work-Prod [Active]" in bright green, "🔒 Personal [Encrypted]" in soft blue. Two horizontal progress bars labeled "Usage Limit" are visible, one at 40% (green), one at 90% (yellow).
> **Environment:** The laptop sits on a minimal dark-wood desk with soft, bokeh out-of-focus city lights in the background (purple/blue hues).
> **Style:** Premium product photography, macro lens focusing on the sharp typography of the terminal.
> **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape)
